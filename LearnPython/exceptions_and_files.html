                <h3>Assertions in Python</h3>

                <p>An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.
                <p>The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a raise-if statement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.
                <p>Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, introduced in version 1.5.
                <p>Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output.

                <pre><code>
                >>> print('Hello world!')
                Hello world!
                </code></pre>

                <p>Try it below

                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

    <div class="col-md-12">
        <div class="content">
            <h3>The assert Statement</h3>
            <p>When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises an AssertionError exception.
            <p>The syntax for assert is −
            <pre><code>
            assert Expression[, Arguments]
            </code></pre>

            <p>If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception using the try-except statement, but if not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Here is a function that converts a temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit. Since zero degrees Kelvin is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negative temperature −
            <pre><code>
            #!/usr/bin/python
            def KelvinToFahrenheit(Temperature):
            assert (Temperature >= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
            return ((Temperature-273)*1.8)+32
            print KelvinToFahrenheit(273)
            print int(KelvinToFahrenheit(505.78))
            print KelvinToFahrenheit(-5)
            </code></pre>

            <p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −
            <pre><code>
            32.0
            451
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
            print KelvinToFahrenheit(-5)
            File "test.py", line 4, in KelvinToFahrenheit
            assert (Temperature >= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
            AssertionError: Colder than absolute zero!
            </code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>

            <h3>What is Exception?</h3>
            <p>An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.

            <p>When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.

            <h3>Handling an exception</h3>
            <p>If you have some suspicious code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a try: block. After the try: block, include an except: statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.

            <h3>Syntax</h3>
            <p>Here is simple syntax of try....except...else blocks −
            <pre><code>
            try:
                You do your operations here;
                ......................
            except ExceptionI:
                If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.
            except ExceptionII:
                If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.
                ......................
            else:
                If there is no exception then execute this block.
            </code></pre>
            <p>Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax −
            <p>A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.
            <p>You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.
            <p>After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.
            <p>The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.

            <h3>Python - Files I/O</h3>
            <p>This chapter covers all the basic I/O functions available in Python. For more functions, please refer to
                standard Python documentation.
            <h3>Printing to the Screen</h3>
            <p>The simplest way to produce output is using the print statement where you can pass zero or more
                expressions separated by commas. This function converts the expressions you pass into a string and
                writes the result to standard output as follows −
            <pre><code>
            print "Python is really a great language,", "isn't it?"
            </code></pre>
            <p>This produces the following result on your standard screen −
            <pre><code>
            Python is really a great language, isn't it?
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Reading Keyboard Input</h3>
            <p>Python provides two built-in functions to read a line of text from standard input, which by default comes
                from the keyboard. These functions are
            <p>raw_input
            <p>input

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-12">
        <div class="content">
            <h3>The raw_input Function</h3>
            <p>The raw_input([prompt]) function reads one line from standard input and returns it as a string (removing
                the trailing newline).
            <pre><code>
            str = raw_input("Enter your input: ");
            print "Received input is : ", str
            </code></pre>
            <p>This prompts you to enter any string and it would display same string on the screen. When I typed "Hello
                Python!", its output is like this −
            <pre><code>
            Enter your input: Hello Python
            Received input is :  Hello Python
            </code></pre>

            <h3>The input Function</h3>
            <p>The input([prompt]) function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes the input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.</p>
            <pre><code>
            str = input("Enter your input: ");
            print "Received input is : ", str
            </code></pre>
            <p>This would produce the following result against the entered input −</p>
            <pre><code>
            Enter your input: [x*5 for x in range(2,10,2)]
            Recieved input is :  [10, 20, 30, 40]

            <h3>Opening and Closing Files</h3>
            <p>Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how to use actual data files.
            <p>Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a file object.
            <h3>The open Function</h3>
            <p>Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates a file object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.
            <h3>Syntax</h3>
            <pre><code>
            file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])
                </code></pre>
            <p>Here are parameter details −
            <p><code>file_name</code> − The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access.
            <p><code>access_mode</code> − The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values is given below in the table. This is optional parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).
            <p><code>buffering</code> − If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).
